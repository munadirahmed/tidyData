These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'...XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Variables:
======================================
tBodyAcc...XYZ

tGravityAcc...XYZ

tBodyAccJerk...XYZ

tBodyGyro...XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk...XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc...XYZ

fBodyAccJerk...XYZ

fBodyGyro...XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

Extensions:
======================================
.mean: is the mean value of the collected measurement in the raw dataset

.std: is the standard deviation of the measurement in the raw dataset

Prefix:
======================================
t: refers to time domain measurements

f: refers to frequency domain measurements

Please refer to "features_info.txt" file in the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" that contains the raw data for a detailed description of the measurements. A "README.txt" file is also available in this folder explaining the different files present in that folder.
